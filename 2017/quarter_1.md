 # TF1 Research
 
 * Two colombian students started his PhD on Radioastronomy Instrumenation in Chile. This was possible through the
 institutional and personal relationships started in the Andean ROAD.
 
 # TF2 Children 
 * We had an activity in the Andean region to measure the local latitude on March 20. This activity was
 performed by instructors in their schools together with their students.
 
 # Global
 * We will have the third "Astronomy en los Andes" workshop in Peru, in December 2017. This workshop focuses on
 gathering all the Andean ROAD institutions to share results and plan future actions.
* Angela Perez (TF2 coordinator) will visit Brazil in September to meet our PLOAD colleagues and open up lines of 
collaboration with them.
