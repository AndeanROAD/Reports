*1. What has your regional office managed to achieve thus far?*

- Gather a transnational group people interested on the OAD goals. This has allowed us to start regional meetings and collaborative projects both in TF1 and TF2.
- Visibilize the role of the IAU in aspects that go beyond astronomical research.
- Motivate colleagues in Ecuador and Peru to re-organize to become IAU members.

*2. What, if anything, has prevented you from achieving what you would have wanted to achieve?*
- Lack of committed contacts in Ecuador, Bolivia to join us in TF2 projects.
- Lack of a committed TF3 coordinator to support and follow up TF3 projects.

*3. What would you like to see going forward, both in terms of support that the OAD can offer, and your own ambitions for the regional office.*
- In terms of our own ambitions we have to develop strategies to be efficient in recruiting, motivating and following up on volunteers.
- In terms of the OAD support we would like to have the support to submit proposals to get funding on the order of 50K USD for each regional office.
