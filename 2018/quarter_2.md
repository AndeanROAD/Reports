# TF1

* Our TF1 coordinator (German Chaparro) contributed to the OAD Data Science Toolkit of the OAD with an introductory course of Python 3 in Spanish. The course can be found here https://github.com/astro4dev/OAD-Data-Science-Toolkit/tree/master/Teaching%20Materials/Programming/Python/Python3Espanol


# TF2

* Valentina Rodriguez, through the GMT in Chile, has invited our TF2 coordinator (Angela Perez) to Chile to run a teacher training workshop with the "Astronomy Suitcase with All Senses." As in Chile they have one of the suitcases, they decided to build an Astronomy truck including the Suitcase (more info here: http://playfm.cl/playfm/tendencias/este-proyecto-busca-ensenar-astronomia-a-los-ciegos/2017-08-15/161500.html). She will attend training the last week of August and will participate on behalf of TF2, giving a conference, in the Astronomy and Education Summit the first week of September. 

* An Argentine media producer contacted our TF2 coordinator to get ROAD support for a project to make a TV program of Astronomy for children.  

# TF3 

* Farid Char quit his position as TF3 coordinator. The Chilean Astronomical Society hasn't appointed anyone to replace him.
