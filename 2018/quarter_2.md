# TF2

* Valentina Rodriguez, through the GMT, has invited our TF2 coordinator to Chile to run a teacher training workshop with the "Astronomy Suitcase with All Senses." As in Chile they have one of the suitcases, they decided to build an Astronomy truck including the Suitcase (more info here: http://playfm.cl/playfm/tendencias/este-proyecto-busca-ensenar-astronomia-a-los-ciegos/2017-08-15/161500.html). She will attend training the last week of August and will participate on behalf of TF2, giving a conference, in the Astronomy and Education Summit the first week of September. 

* An Argentine media producer contacted our TF2 coordinator to get ROAD support for a project to make a TV program of Astronomy for children.  

# TF3 

* Farid Char quit his position as TF3 coordinator. The Chilean Astronomical Socienty hasn't appointed anyone to replace him.
