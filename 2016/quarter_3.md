* Setup the program for the [OAD Workshop at the Latin American Regional IAU Meeting 2016](https://andeanroad.github.io/WorkshopLARIM2016/).  

* Gave feedback to 40+ OAD expressions of interest. Decided to support twelve of them (6 TF1, 5 TF2, 1 TF3). Started to work directly with three projects.

* Will have our first Steering Committee Meeting later this week (September 29, 2016).
